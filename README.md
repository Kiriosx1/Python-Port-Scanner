# 🔍 Simple Python Port Scanner

A lightweight, beginner-friendly TCP port scanner written in Python.  
It scans a target IP address or domain for open and closed ports in a specified range.

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Scans a given range of TCP ports on a target
- Identifies open and closed ports
- Lightweight and easy to understand
- Built using only Python standard libraries
- Beginner-friendly and easily extendable

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x

Install dependencies (if any are added in future):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Currently, there are no external dependencies – everything uses Python's built-in modules.

🧪 How to Use
bash
Copy
Edit
python scanner.py
You will be prompted to enter:

Target IP address or domain (e.g., scanme.nmap.org)

Start port (e.g., 1)

End port (e.g., 1000)

The script will then scan the specified ports and display results like:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
[+] Port 22 is open
[-] Port 23 is closed
...
⚠️ Legal Disclaimer
This tool is for educational purposes only.
Do not scan targets that you do not own or have explicit permission to scan. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

📌 To-Do / Planned Updates
🧵 Add multithreading support for faster scanning

🧾 Export scan results to a text or CSV file

🎛️ Add command-line argument support (argparse)

🌐 Add optional UDP port scanning

🖥️ GUI or web-based interface

Stay tuned — more updates coming soon!

### 📦 `requirements.txt`

Since you’re using only standard libraries (`socket`, `datetime`), this file can be **empty** for now:

```txt
# No external dependencies yet
You can leave it like that or just add a comment.

Let me know when you're ready to:

Add threading or argparse

Or publish this on GitHub (I can help write a .gitignore and guide you through commit & push)








You said:
do i need to add a requirements.txt to my github and if so and it will be better tell me what to write inside


ChatGPT said:
Yes — even though your script doesn’t require any external libraries right now, it’s still a good idea to include a requirements.txt file in your GitHub repository.

✅ Why Include It?
It shows you understand Python project structure.

It makes it easier to add future features (e.g., argparse, colorama, threading interface, etc.).

It’s expected in nearly all Python projects, even if empty.

📝 What to Write in requirements.txt Now
Since you're only using built-in modules (no installation needed), here's a minimal and professional version:

txt
Copy
Edit
# No external dependencies required.
# Uses only Python 3.x standard library.
Alternatively, if you want to future-proof it for any additions:

txt
Copy
Edit
# Python 3.x standard library modules only.
# Future dependencies will be added here.
This looks better than an empty file and shows awareness.

✅ Best Practice: Include These Files in GitHub
When you push your project, make sure to include:

scanner.py

README.md

requirements.txt

(Optional later: .gitignore, LICENSE, etc.)

Would you like help with:

Creating a .gitignore?

Writing your GitHub repo description or tags?

First-time commit and push instructions?

Let me know!








You said:
add to readme more uptdate coming and say some suggestions


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — here’s your updated README.md with a better "Planned Updates & Suggestions" section at the end.
