## 🚀 Getting Started

🧪 How to Use:

run in your terminal:
python scanner.py

You will be prompted to enter:

Target IP address or domain (e.g., scanme.nmap.org)

Start port (e.g., 1)

End port (e.g., 1000)

The script will then scan the specified ports and display results like:

[+] Port 22 is open
[-] Port 23 is closed
...
pretty simple no need to stress/n
